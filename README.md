# movieApi

## Project structure:

I used vue frontend and nodjes express backend so user can sign up, login,
add movies, delete movies, update movies, search movies.

## How to start

- Clone app to computer:

````
  git clone https://github.com/mikk369/movieApi.git
  cd to movieApi folder
  Make npm install to get dependencies```

- .env template:

  DATABASE =
  PORT =
  USERNAME =
  PASSWORD =

  JWT_SECRET=
  JWT_EXPIRES_IN=
  JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=


````

- Split terminal and run "npm run serve" to start client side
  and "npm run dev" to run server.
